# TDD demo

This project is starter code for a test-driven development session.

## Set up

1. Make sure you're using a recent LTS node version. I'm on version 20.
2. `npm install`
3. `npx cypress open`
4. In Cypress, open component tests and run `00-HelloWorld` test suite and check both tests pass.
5. If you have GitHub Copilot, please disable it for this workspace.

Optional: Install the recommended extension as it will highlight TODO comments
